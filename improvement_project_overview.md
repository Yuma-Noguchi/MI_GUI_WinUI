# MI_GUI_WinUI Improvement Project Overview

## Project Documentation

This improvement project is documented across several detailed markdown files:

1. [Architecture Improvement Plan](architecture_improvement_plan.md)
   - Overall architecture vision
   - Detailed improvement areas
   - Implementation timeline
   - Risk analysis and mitigation strategies

2. [Implementation Guide](implementation_guide.md)
   - Step-by-step implementation instructions
   - Code examples and patterns
   - Migration strategies
   - Best practices

3. [Testing Strategy](testing_strategy.md)
   - Comprehensive testing approach
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Quality gates
   - Continuous integration setup

## Quick Start

1. Review the architecture_improvement_plan.md first to understand the overall vision and timeline
2. Use implementation_guide.md as your primary reference during implementation
3. Follow testing_strategy.md to ensure quality and validation of changes

## Implementation Priority

1. High Priority (Weeks 1-2)
   - Dependency injection setup
   - Repository pattern implementation
   - Unit of Work pattern implementation

2. Medium Priority (Weeks 3-4)
   - ViewModel refactoring
   - Validation layer implementation
   - Service layer improvements

3. Lower Priority (Weeks 5-6)
   - Testing infrastructure
   - Performance optimizations
   - Documentation updates

## Key Success Metrics

1. Code Quality
   - Test coverage > 80%
   - All new code follows MVVM pattern
   - No direct file system access in ViewModels
   - Properly abstracted services

2. Performance
   - Application startup < 2 seconds
   - Profile loading < 1 second
   - Smooth UI interactions

3. Maintainability
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Documented architecture
   - Consistent patterns usage
   - Reduced code duplication
