\chapter*{Abstract}

This project presents the development of a Configuration Graphical User Interface (GUI) for MotionInput, an accessibility software that enables alternative methods of computer interaction. The GUI aims to enhance the gaming experience for users with physical disabilities by providing an intuitive interface for managing visual profiles and mapping configurations.

The implementation utilizes the WinUI 3 framework to create a modern, native Windows application that integrates seamlessly with the existing MotionInput ecosystem. The GUI allows users to create, modify, and manage visual profiles that define how physical movements are translated into game controls, making games more accessible to players with diverse physical abilities.

Key features include a visual profile editor, real-time configuration preview, profile management system, and integration with various input devices. The project emphasizes user-centered design principles and accessibility guidelines throughout its development process.

This dissertation details the research, design, implementation, and evaluation of the Configuration GUI, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the accessibility of computer games for users with physical disabilities.
