# GitHub Actions Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Basic CI Infrastructure

### 1.1 Initial Workflow Setup
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        configuration: [Debug, Release]
        platform: [x64]
```

### 1.2 Required Repository Setup
1. Branch Protection Rules
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require code coverage check
   - Protect main and develop branches

2. Repository Secrets
   ```
   AZURE_CREDENTIALS - For Azure resources access
   CODECOV_TOKEN - For coverage reporting
   GPU_TEST_LICENSE - For GPU testing capabilities
   ```

## Phase 2: Test Categories Implementation

### 2.1 Unit Tests Workflow
- Non-GPU dependent tests
- Coverage reporting
- Fast execution for PR validation

### 2.2 Integration Tests
- Service integration validation
- Cross-component testing
- Resource management verification

### 2.3 GPU-Specific Tests
```yaml
# .github/workflows/platform-tests.yml
name: Platform Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  gpu-tests:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, gpu]
```

## Phase 3: Performance Testing

### 3.1 Nightly Performance Tests
```yaml
# .github/workflows/nightly.yml
name: Nightly Tests

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  performance:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, windows, gpu]
```

### 3.2 Benchmark Tracking
- Setup benchmark baseline
- Configure performance gates
- Implement regression detection

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 4.1 GPU Resource Management
1. Detection Scripts
   ```powershell
   # .github/scripts/detect-gpu.ps1
   # GPU detection and validation
   ```

2. Resource Pooling
   ```powershell
   # Test resource allocation
   # GPU memory management
   ```

### 4.2 Test Result Processing
1. Coverage Analysis
   - Set minimum coverage requirements
   - Track coverage trends
   - Generate reports

2. Performance Metrics
   - Benchmark comparisons
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Performance regression alerts
