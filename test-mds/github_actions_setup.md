# GitHub Actions Setup Instructions

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented as a single workflow that handles:
- GPU detection and validation
- Building and testing on GPU-enabled runners
- Performance testing and benchmarking

## Directory Structure

```bash
.github/
└── workflows/
    └── ci.yml
```

## CI Pipeline Implementation (ci.yml)

The workflow consists of two main jobs:

1. `detect-gpu`: Detects available GPU hardware
2. `build-and-test`: Runs tests if GPU is available

### Key Features

- GPU Detection
  - Identifies NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel GPUs
  - Skips testing if no GPU is available
  
- Test Categories
  - GPU-specific tests (TestCategory=RequiresGpu)
  - Performance tests (TestCategory=Performance)
  - Benchmarks

- Artifacts Collection
  - Test results (.trx files)
  - Code coverage reports
  - Benchmark results

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the workflow directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. Configure GitHub repository:
   - Add required secrets
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Configure test result viewing

3. Test Setup
   - Tag GPU tests with [TestCategory("RequiresGpu")]
   - Tag performance tests with [TestCategory("Performance")]
   - Set up benchmark configurations

## Test Execution

The workflow runs:
1. GPU hardware detection
2. Main test suite (if GPU available)
3. Performance tests
4. Benchmarks

All results are collected and stored as artifacts for analysis.

## Notes

- Tests only run on machines with GPU support
- Performance tests run as part of the main CI pipeline
- Results are preserved as artifacts for tracking and analysis
